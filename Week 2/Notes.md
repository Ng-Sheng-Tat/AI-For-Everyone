### Key steps of a machine learning project
1. Collect data
2. Train the model
    - iterate many times until good enough
3. Deploy model (put into practice)
    - get data back
    - maintain and update model

### Key steps of a data science project
1. Collect data
2. Analyze data
    - iterate many times to get good and reasonable insights
3. Suggest hypotheses / actions
    - deploy changes 
    - re-analyze new data periodically

- both projects attempt to solve problem at the first place

### Data Science and Machine Learning
| Data Science | Machine Learning |
| :----: | :---:|
| It is the brain that identifies what types of problems arise and the possible root causes and solutios for it | It is the actions taker that is more robust is solving *automated problems* |

### How to choose Machine Learning Approaches?
- only attempts solutions that are feasible by AI experts (technical diligence) and domain knowledge that will benefit your business (business diligence) -> *due diligence on project*

**Brain Storming Framework**
- automating the tasks rather than automating the jobs position
- what is the main drivers of business value?
- what are the main pain points in your business?

- big and *good* data sets never hurts your machine learning model, but small data set allow you to progress as well

**Due Diligence on Project**
| Technical Diligence | Business Diligence |
| :---: | :---: |
| Can AI system meet desired performance | Lower costs |
| How much data is needed | Increase revenue |
| Engineering timeline | Launch new product or business (for the sake of both new or current business) |

- company might take into account *ethical diligence*
- machine learning project can be in-house or outsourced
- data science projects often in-house
- avoid building industry standard machine learning model as it will consume many money and time

### Working with AI team
- you should specify your level of acceptance to the AI team
- AI team view the data as training set and test set separately
- 100% accuracy does not always being attainable, it could be due to several reasons: limitations of machine learning, insufficient of data, mislabeled data, ambiguous data, etc
- certainly there is action that could be done to improve your model and algorithms

### AI technical tools

**Machine Learning Framework**
TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, MXNet, CNTK, Caffe, PaddlePaddle, Scikit-learn, R, Weka

**Research Publications**: Arxiv

**Open Source Repositories**: GitHub
