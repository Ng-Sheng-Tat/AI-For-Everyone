### Case Study on Complex AI projects
**Speech Recognition**
1. Trigger word/wakeword detection
2. Speech recognition
3. Intent recognition
4. Execute joke
- each of these tasks take an input to an output, each must be done correctly so that you can get your intended output --> *AI pipeline*

**Self-Driving Car**
1. Image/Radar
2. Object Detection and Recognition
3. Motion Planning
4. Steer/Accelerate/Brake

### Role of an AI team
- software engineer
    - job execution, ensure self-driving reliability
- machine learning engineer
    - train neural networks and gather data
- machine learning researcher
    - extend state-of-the-art in machine learning
- applied ML Scientists
    - combination of machine learning engineer and machine learning researcher
- data scientist
    - examine data and provide insights
    - make presentation to team/executive
- data engineer
    - organize data
    - make sure data is saved in an easily accessible, secure, and cost effective way
- AI product manager
    - help decide what to build; what's feasible and valuable

### AI Transformation Playbook
1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
    - it is important for the initial project to succeed rather than be the most valuable
2. Build an in-house AI team
3. Provide broad AI training
4. Develop an AI strategy
    - Design a strategy that aligns with the "Virtuous Cycle of AI"
    - better product -> more users -> more data -> even more good products
    - consider creating a data strategy
        1. Strategic data acquisition
        2. Unified data warehouse
    - create network effects and platform advantages
        - "winner take all" dynamics: AI is an accelerator
5. Develop internal and external communications

### AI pitfalls to avoid
- don't expect AI to solve everything, AI has its limitations
- usually AI project does not work for the first time, it is an iterative process to develop a good AI model

### Applications of AI
**Computer Vision**
1. Image classification/Object recognition/Face Recognition
2. Object Detection
3. Image Segmentation
4. Tracking

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
1. Text Classification
    - sentiment recognition
2. Information Retrieval 
    - web search
3. Name entity recognition
4. Machine Translation
5. Part-of-speech tagging (determination of whether the word is a noun, ....)
6. Parsing (classify group of words together and find meaning of the phrase and making it up into sentences)

**Speech**
1. Speech Recognition (speech-to-text)
2. Trigger word/wakeword detection
3. Speaker ID
4. Speech synthesis (text-to-speech, TTS) with human-like tone

**Robotics**
1. Perception
2. Motion Planning
3. Control

- AI can work on *structured* and *unstructured data*

### Other Learning Algorithms Regime
**Unsupervised Learning**
- e.g. clustering
- given data (without any specific desired output labels) and find something interesting about the data
- consume less examples to learn from labelled supervised learning
- more intuitive learning methods for humans and AI

**Transfer Learning**
- learn from task A, and use knowledge to help on task B

**Reinforcement Learning**
- rewards-punishment approaches in teaching AI doing the right things

**Generative Adversarial Network (GANs)**
- synthesizing new images from scratch
- use in the entertainment industry

**Knowledge Graph**
- terms initialized by *Google*
- when you search something, automatically pull the relevant information in a table format, which is increadible useful, especially for web-searching
