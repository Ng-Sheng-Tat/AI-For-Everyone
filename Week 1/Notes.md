### Demystifying AI

**AI** can be classified into *Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)* which is AI that is very particularly good at doing a particular tasks and *Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)*, which is the AI can do anything a human can do or even better. Most of the AI of todays that greatly advancing is ANI instead of AGI. 

### What is Machine Learning?
- machine learning is an algorithm that takes in input and produce a desire output, with this functions there could by multiple applications to be used.

### What is data?
- what is the essence of machine learning is the data that feed into it, so that it can do what it meant to do
- data can be in dataset form (text) or in images format
- acquiring data can be through manual labelling, observations (survey or login capture system, sensors)
- download from websites or partnership
- it is adviced to build machine learning model while in the midst of acquiring data so that the AI team can feedback to whether your data collections is good or bad
- *do not assume that you have more data, you can build a machine learning model*
- usually data is *messy*, and if your feed in bad data, AI learns the wrong patterns, terming "garbage in-garbage out"
- data problems include: missing values, incorrect labels, multitypes data (images, audio, text, unstructured data)

### Recent Technological Terms
- Machine Learning Against Data Science
 
| Machine Learning     | Data Science |
| :----: | :----: |
| Field of study that give insigits to machine learning model without being explicitly programmed     | Getting insights from data      |
| A->B   | Presentation to drive business decisions        |

- Deep Learining (Neural Network)
- feeding in a bunch of input into an *artificial neural network (ANN)* and produce an output
- originally inspired by biological brains, but almost unrelated
- an artificial neural network is composed of *mathematics equations*

### What makes a good AI company?
- strategic data acquisition
- unified data warehouse from different sources
- pervasive automation
- new roles such as machine learning engineer and division of labour

**AI Transformations**
1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
2. Build an in-house AI team
3. Provide broad AI training
4. Develop an AI strategy
5. Develop internal and external communications

### What Machine Leanring Can and Cannot Do?
- nowadays machine leanrning can do everything that humans can do with a thought of seconds
- however, it might not be able to perform tasks that even human need to think and filter, like responding an email accurately like human might be able to do and especially one same movement can means multiple things
- to make a machine learning problem simple, it should be learning *a simple concept* and you have *a lots of data for both input and output*
- you should not relies on AI system if you need a high accuracy of prediction
- machine leanring problem become hard when it tries to learn complicated tasks/concepts from small amounts of data
- asked to perform things on data that it has not seen before, even if it seen before but with slight modifications

### Demsyfying Deep Learning
- deep learning is feeding an input, and going though the *layers of neurons* to perceive the output
- figure out what is means by each layer is the tasks for engineers
